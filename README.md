# Machine-Learning-assignment

Hey! Welcome to this repo!

This is an assignment I completed for a Data Science course provided by edX - DA0101EN.

The goal of this assignment is to predict the prices of automobiles. The code here demonstrates how to build, train and evaluate three linear regression models - Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, and Polynomial Regression. Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to visualize the the models to give a better sense of the overfitting-underfitting issue.

Thank you for reading.

Stay well.
